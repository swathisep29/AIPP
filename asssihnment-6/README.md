## AI Autocomplete Exploration (Python)

This small interactive program exercises core Python constructs so you can observe and evaluate AI-powered code completion and logic suggestions.

### Includes
- Class (`Person`) with methods
- For/while loops
- Conditionals and branching
- Basic parsing and simple statistics

### Run
```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts:
- Your name
- Your age (integer)
- A comma-separated list of numbers (e.g., `1, 2, -3, 4.5`)
- Countdown start value

### Evaluation Tips
- Completeness: Are class methods, loops, and conditionals implemented end-to-end without gaps?
- Correctness: Do stats (count/sum/mean/min/max) match expectations? Are invalid numeric entries ignored safely?
- Robustness: How does it behave with empty inputs or invalid data?
- Readability: Are names, structure, and flow clear without extra comments?

### What to Try With Your AI Assistant
- Ask it to extend `Person` with validation or formatting.
- Add median or standard deviation to `compute_statistics`.
- Replace the `while` countdown with a generator or recursion and compare.
- Introduce error handling strategies (e.g., custom exceptions) and discuss trade-offs.
